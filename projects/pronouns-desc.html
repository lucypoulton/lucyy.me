    </li>

        see "Custom Pronouns" below for more info!)

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Predefined Pronouns</h3>
To use these sets, you don't need to type out all 6 pronouns! Just use the first one out of these sets:
<ul>
    <li><b>he </b>(he/him/he's/his/his/himself)</li>
    <li><b>she </b>(she/her/she's/her/hers/herself)</li>
    <li><b>they </b>(they/them/they're/their/theirs/themself)</li>
    <li><b>any</b> (uses they/them in placeholders but shows as "Any")</li>
    <li><b>ask</b> (uses they/them in placeholders but shows as "Ask")</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Custom Pronouns</h3>
Are your pronouns not listed in /pronouns list? No problem! Setting custom pronouns is super easy. Here's how you do it:

<b>/pronouns set subjective/objective/progressive/possessive-adj/possessive-pronoun/reflexive</b>

Here are some examples just in case you're not a linguist:
/pronouns set he/him/he's/his/his/himself
/pronouns set she/her/she's/her/hers/herself
/pronouns set they/them/they're/their/theirs/themself
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Filter</h3>
To prevent abuse, the plugin is equipped with a basic regex-based filter. By default it detects the words "apache" and "helicopter". It can be disabled and custom rules can be added
<b>from the config</b>. Players with the permission <b>pronouns.bypass</b> will not be affected by this
</p>

<b>PlaceholderAPI
</b>
ProNouns provides a selection of PAPI placeholders so you can use pronouns in messages!
Before using these, install the PlaceholderAPI expansion with <b>/papi ecloud download pronouns</b> followed by <b>/papi
    reload</b>.
<ul>
    <li>%pronouns_pronouns% - pronouns, in the Subjective/Objective format ie She/Her
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_subjective% - subjective pronoun
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_objective% - objective pronoun
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_progressive% - progressive pronoun
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_possessiveadj% - possessive adjective
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_possessivepro% - possessive pronoun
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_reflexive% - reflexive pronouns
    </li>
    <li>%pronouns_all% - all 6 pronouns
    </li>
</ul>
All placeholders also have some formatting modifiers that can be added to the end of the name to control capitalisation:
<ul>
    <li>upper - uppercase (SHE)

    </li>
    <li>lower - lowercase (she)

    </li>
    <li>capital - first letter uppercase, everything else lowercase (She)
    </li>
</ul>
Some examples using the she/her pronoun set:

<ul>
    <li>%pronouns_subjective_upper% - SHE
    </li>
    <li>%pronoun_possessivepro_capital% - Hers
    </li>
</ul>
