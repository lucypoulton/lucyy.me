# How ProNouns should store data. There are two acceptable values for this:
# - 'yml' (default) - stores data in a file. Use this if you're not sure what to use.
# - 'mysql' stores data in a MySQL database. Suitable for BungeeCord servers.
connection: yml

# MySQL settings. These values will be ignored if MySQL is not being used.
mysql:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3306
  database: pronouns
  username: pronouns
  password: password

# Add extra pronoun sets to the predefined list.
# This means users can type out the set like they would with the defaults (he/she/they). Default is [] (empty). Sets should be written out in the standard full-set (6) format
