<h1>Setting your pronouns</h1>

<p>To set your pronouns, use the "/pronouns set" command.</p>
<p>There are a number of different ways to set your pronouns:</p>

<p>
<h3>Predefined Pronouns</h3>
To use these sets, you don't need to type out all 6 pronouns. Just use the first one out of these sets:
<ul>
    <li><b>he</b></li>
    <li><b>she</b></li>
    <li><b>they</b></li>
    <li><b>any</b> (uses they/them in placeholders but shows as "Any")</li>
    <li><b>ask</b> (uses they/them in placeholders but shows as "Ask")</li>
    <li><b>Server admins may add more sets to this list</b> - use the command "/pronouns list" to see them</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Custom Pronouns</h3>
If your pronouns aren't listed above, you can still use them, you just need to write them out in full.
The format is as follows:
<h4>subjective/objective/progressive/possessive-adj/possessive-pronoun/reflexive</h4>
For example, the they/them pronoun set written out full would be <b>they/them/they're/their/theirs/themself</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>Multiple Sets</h3>
You can use multiple sets at the same time. If you're using multiple predefined sets, you can chain them together
with a slash, for example "she/they". Otherwise, separate them with a space, for example "she they" (this works with the
full set format too).
