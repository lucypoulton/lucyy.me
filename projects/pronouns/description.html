<h3>Predefined Pronouns</h3>
To use these sets, you don't need to type out all 6 pronouns! Just use the first one out of these sets:
<ul>
    <li><b>he </b>(he/him/he's/his/his/himself)</li>
    <li><b>she </b>(she/her/she's/her/hers/herself)</li>
    <li><b>they </b>(they/them/they're/their/theirs/themself)</li>
    <li><b>any</b> (uses they/them in placeholders but shows as "Any")</li>
    <li><b>ask</b> (uses they/them in placeholders but shows as "Ask")</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Custom Pronouns</h3>
Are your pronouns not listed in /pronouns list? No problem! Setting custom pronouns is super easy. See
<a href="/pronouns/wiki/set">the wiki page</a> for more info.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Filter</h3>
To prevent abuse, the plugin is equipped with a basic regex-based filter. By default it detects the words "apache" and "helicopter". It can be disabled and custom rules can be added
<b>from the config</b>. Players with the permission <b>pronouns.bypass</b> will not be affected by this
</p>
