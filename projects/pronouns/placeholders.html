<h3>Placeholders</h3>

ProNouns provides some PlaceholderAPI placeholders. No eCloud expansion is needed - it's built into the plugin.

<ul>
    <li>%pronouns_pronouns% - pronouns, in the Subjective/Objective format ie She/Her</li>
    <li>%pronouns_subjective% - subjective pronoun (they)</li>
    <li>%pronouns_objective% - objective pronoun (them)</li>
    <li>%pronouns_progressive% - progressive pronoun (they're)</li>
    <li>%pronouns_possessiveadj% - possessive adjective (their)</li>
    <li>%pronouns_possessivepro% - possessive pronoun (theirs)</li>
    <li>%pronouns_reflexive% - reflexive pronoun (themself)</li>
    <li>%pronouns_all% - all 6 pronouns</li>
</ul>
All placeholders also have some formatting modifiers that can be added to the end of the name to control capitalisation:

<ul>
    <li>upper - uppercase (SHE)</li>
    <li>lower - lowercase (she)</li>
    <li>capital - first letter uppercase, everything else lowercase (She)</li>
</ul>
Some examples using the she/her pronoun set:

<ul>
    <li>%pronouns_subjective_upper% - SHE</li>
    <li>%pronoun_possessivepro_capital% - Hers</li>
</ul>
